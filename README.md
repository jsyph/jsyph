# Hello! 👋
I am Youssef Khaled, a *Computer Engineering* student at _The Arab Academy of Science and Technology_ and ECPC 2024 finalist.

I am interested in:

- 🦀 Rust
- 🐍 Python
- 🐧 Linux (i use arch btw)
- 🧰 Computer architecture and design
- 🧠 Competetive Programming

Other than that, I enjoy creating things that are useful to me and other people, regardless of the language or technology used.
